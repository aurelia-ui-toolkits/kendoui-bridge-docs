# 1.4 Installation

The **[Installation page](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendo-ui-library-installation-version-2-0/content/)** contains detailed description several installation variants of the Aurelia Kendo UI Bridge and Kendo UI Library (often referred to as a framework). The installation depends mainly on the tooling you plan to use when building your Aurelia applications.

Note that Telerik's decision to distribute its framework via npm (see **[here](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/intro/installation/npm)** for details) has dramatically simplified the process of installing it for the use with Aurelia Kend UI Bridge - all the different previous variants are reduced to just two, dependent on whether the application uses JSPM or not; see **[Kendo UI Library installation - section General comments](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendo-ui-library-installation-version-2-0/content/library-installation/general-comments.html)** for more details.
