###The Aurelia Experience

With its strong focus on developer experience, Aurelia can enable you to not only create amazing applications, but also enjoy the process. We've designed it with simple conventions in mind so you don't need to waste time with tons of configuration or write boilerplate code just to satisfy a stubborn or restrictive framework. You'll never hit a roadblock with Aurelia either. It's been carefully designed to be pluggable and customizable.

Over the last 10 years we've labored in building a variety of front-end libraries and frameworks on several different platforms. These libraries have been used to develop thousands of applications for virtually every industry. We've harnessed this rich experience and used it to build Aurelia, the most advanced and developer friendly front-end framework today. **We're sure you're going to love it.**

### Blue Spire
Aurelia isn't just another framework. It's backed by **[Blue Spire](http://bluespire.com/)**, a company with a ten year history dedicated to advancing rich web app development by creating powerful libraries, frameworks and tools.

#### We have a long term vision.

Aurelia is the first step in realizing that vision. We believe it's critical to start with a completely free, open source application framework. We want to enable anyone to build amazing apps for many years to come and to know that they are building on a platform that isn't just here today and gone tomorrow. We're investing heavily in both building and supporting Aurelia and we're truly excited about what's in store!
