# 4.1 Introduction

The collection of articles contained in this **App developers tutorials** help section, (_which begins with this article you are reading now_),  presents six short tutorials describing the process of adding Aurelia KendoUI `autocomplete` component to an Aurelia application.

In order to cover all platforms and tooling choices currently supported by Aurelia, we show the above mentioned process applied to each of the **[skeleton navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** applications:

and explaining how to use **KendoUI-core** and **KendoUI Pro** versions of Telerik's KendoUI SDK associated with the **[Aurelia-KendoUI-bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-bridge)** Aurelia plugin.

As the result we are providing all **completed** tutorials in the **[kendoui-skeleton](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/kendoui-skeleton)**, shown below:

**Note:** use these ___completed___ tutorials if you get lost following the tutorial instructions or you just want to see how each of these applications work. 

**Caveat** due to frequent changes in Aurelia Framework (something that is normal in early stages of any major software component) we cannot guarantee the correct functioning of these completed tutorials. Since they are provided mostly to show the "global view" of using KendoUI components in an Aurelia application, we hope that this inconvenience will be accepted)
